# Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow and Keras

I explored various deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. These models are essential for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and generative art.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Overview
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are widely used for image classification tasks. They learn hierarchical features from input images by applying convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Key Concepts
- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply filters to input images, capturing local patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Pooling reduces spatial dimensions, preserving important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers connect all neurons from the previous layer to the current layer.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### Overview
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language. They maintain hidden states to capture temporal dependencies.

### Key Concepts
- **Hidden States**: RNNs have recurrent connections that allow them to remember previous inputs.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An RNN variant that mitigates the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: Another RNN variant with fewer parameters than LSTM.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### Overview
**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** consist of a generator and a discriminator. They learn to generate realistic data by competing against each other.

### Key Concepts
- **Generator**: Creates new data samples (e.g., images) from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and generated data.
- **Training Process**: The generator and discriminator improve iteratively through adversarial training.

## Autoencoders

### Overview
**Autoencoders** learn efficient representations of input data. They consist of an encoder and a decoder.

### Key Concepts
- **Encoder**: Maps input data to a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original data from the latent representation.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: A probabilistic variant of autoencoders.
