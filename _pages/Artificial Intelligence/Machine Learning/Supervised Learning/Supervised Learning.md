# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, Matplotlib, pandas, and NumPy
---
---
I explored essential concepts related to supervised learning, along with practical examples using popular Python libraries.

## Data Exploration
---
### Overview
Data exploration is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves understanding the dataset, checking for missing values, visualizing distributions, and identifying potential outliers.

### Key Tasks
- **Loading Data**: Use pandas to load and inspect your dataset.
- **Summary Statistics**: Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.) for numerical features.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots using Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends.

## Feature Engineering
---
### Overview
Feature engineering enhances the quality of input features for machine learning models. It involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, and selecting relevant variables.

### Key Techniques
- **Feature Creation**: Generate new features based on domain knowledge or mathematical operations.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features to ensure consistent scales.
- **Handling Categorical Variables**: Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance scores.

## Models

## Logistic Regression
---
### Overview
Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

### Implementation
- Use scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` class.
- Train the model on labeled data.
- Evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## KNeighborsClassifier
---
### Overview
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm classifies instances based on their similarity to neighboring data points.

### Implementation
- Use scikit-learn's `KNeighborsClassifier`.
- Set the number of neighbors (K) and other hyperparameters.
- Fit the model to the training data and make predictions.

## RandomForest
---
### Overview
Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.

### Implementation
- Use scikit-learn's `RandomForestClassifier` for classification or `RandomForestRegressor` for regression.
- Tune hyperparameters like the number of trees and maximum depth.
- Assess model performance using cross-validation.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
---
### Overview
SVM is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points.

### Implementation
- Use scikit-learn's `SVC` (for classification) or `SVR` (for regression).
- Choose the appropriate kernel (linear, polynomial, or radial basis function).
- Train the model and evaluate its performance.
