At the intersection of quality assurance and artificial intelligence, my role as a Software QA Engineer is all about ensuring the impeccable performance of mobile applications. Leveraging expertise in regression, smoke, and functional testing, I meticulously scrutinize iOS and Android platforms to maintain and elevate software standards. My toolkit includes Jira for defect management, Zephyr for test case improvement, and proxyman for HTTP request/response mocking, all of which contribute to the robustness of the products our team delivers.
